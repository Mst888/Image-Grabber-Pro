- Smart filters for resolution and format
- One-click "same size" grouping
- ZIP bundling and smart filenames
- Compact, modern popup UI with floating toolbar

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎯 Precision Selection
- Area Selection: Drag a rectangle over the page to select multiple images.
- Smart Filters: Quickly filter for high-res images (800×600+) or specific file formats.
- Same Size Mode: Select an image and highlight all images on the page with the same dimensions.
- Visual Feedback: Blue outlines and index badges show selection status in real time.

### 📦 Power Downloads (v1.6+)
- ZIP Bundling: Download all selected images as a single .zip archive.
- Smart Naming Templates: Use `{site}`, `{title}`, `{index}`, etc., to generate useful filenames automatically.
- Subfolder Support: Create subfolders from the popup to organize downloads.

### 🎨 Premium UI/UX
- Compact Popup: Designed for a small footprint (300×500) so it doesn't interrupt your browsing.
- Modern Themes: Onyx Gray, Spotify Green, Classic Blue, and more.
- Floating Toolbar: Quick in-page controls without opening the popup.
